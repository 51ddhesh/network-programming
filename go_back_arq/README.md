## Go-Back-N ARQ Protocol

### Usage
1. Make the `build` directory
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
```

2. Run `CMake` and `Makefile`
```bash
cmake ..
make
```

3. Run the executable
```bash
./out
```

**OR RUN THE SETUP SCRIPT**

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
cd build
./out
```

You can rename the executable file in [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt)
